Whether there is reasonable suspicion depends upon whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the police have \u201cspecific, particularized, and articulable reasons indicating that the person may be involved in criminal activity.\u201d Id. (citing Laime v. State, 347 Ark. 142, 155, 60 S.W.3d 464, 473 (2001)). The State first contends that the canine sniff occurred before the legitimate reason for the traffic stop was completed. Therefore, the State claims, the canine sniff was neither a Fourth Amendment violation nor a violation of Rule 3.1. See Sims, supra; Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405 (2005) (<HOLDING>).
